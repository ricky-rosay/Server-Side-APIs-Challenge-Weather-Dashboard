# <Server side apis weather dashboard>

## Description

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. This is a weather dashboard that uses the 5 day weather forecast to generate weather in whatever city you choose. Local storage stores previous cities you have searched for in the past.
